# VanJamSPE
This project was designed to help learn new techniques and information for two Academic Assistants throughout the school year as a side project.

## Explanation
The original basis for this code was to create a framework in which applications could be later implemented and run using this framework. 

## Usage
The first applications were originally run via command line, then eventually transitioned to makefiles.

On branch 'faceDection' there is a working application in that can be run in Visual Studio using the makefile.
